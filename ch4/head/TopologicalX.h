/**
 *  The {@code TopologicalX} class represents a data type for
 *  determining a topological order of a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
 *  Recall, a digraph has a topological order if and only if it is a DAG.
 *  The <em>hasOrder</em> operation determines whether the digraph has
 *  a topological order, and if so, the <em>order</em> operation
 *  returns one.
 *  <p>
 *  This implementation uses a nonrecursive, queue-based algorithm.
 *  The constructor takes time proportional to <em>V</em> + <em>E</em>
 *  (in the worst case),
 *  where <em>V</em> is the number of vertices and <em>E</em> is the number of edges.
 *  Afterwards, the <em>hasOrder</em> and <em>rank</em> operations takes constant time;
 *  the <em>order</em> operation takes time proportional to <em>V</em>.
 *  <p>
 *  See {@link DirectedCycle}, {@link DirectedCycleX}, and
 *  {@link EdgeWeightedDirectedCycle} to compute a
 *  directed cycle if the digraph is not a DAG.
 *  See {@link Topological} for a recursive version that uses depth-first search.
 *  <p>
 *  For additional documentation,
 *  see <a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/42digraph">Section 4.2</a> of
 *  <i>Algorithms, 4th Edition</i> by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
