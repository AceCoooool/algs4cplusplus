/**
 *  The {@code EulerianCycle} class represents a data type
 *  for finding an Eulerian cycle or path in a graph.
 *  An <em>Eulerian cycle</em> is a cycle (not necessarily simple) that
 *  uses every edge in the graph exactly once.
 *  <p>
 *  This implementation uses a nonrecursive depth-first search.
 *  The constructor runs in O(<Em>E</em> + <em>V</em>) time,
 *  and uses O(<em>E</em> + <em>V</em>) extra space, where <em>E</em> is the
 *  number of edges and <em>V</em> the number of vertices
 *  All other methods take O(1) time.
 *  <p>
 *  To compute Eulerian paths in graphs, see {@link EulerianPath}.
 *  To compute Eulerian cycles and paths in digraphs, see
 *  {@link DirectedEulerianCycle} and {@link DirectedEulerianPath}.
 *  <p>
 *  For additional documentation,
 *  see <a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/41graph">Section 4.1</a> of
 *  <i>Algorithms, 4th Edition</i> by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
